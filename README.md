This is the repository for a random small website. The goal was to discover **web development** mainly ! It is made only with **HTML** and **CSS** !

The website is not available online, but my current portfolio is on the following URL : [victorsimonin.fr](victorsimonin.fr)

## Header Section

The **Header** page is the fixed point of the website, it expose a small logo and few buttons to go on different pages and sign up.
